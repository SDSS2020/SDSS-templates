 This repository provides basic templates for the 2-page SDSS 2020 contributed paper submission.
and some submission guidelines.
The templates are available in LaTex and Microsoft word.
The online submission system will require a short abstract which will be used for the online program. You will be able to
attach a 2-page pdf created using one of the templates.
Submissions of contributed papers will be accepted for consideration from December 4, 2019, to January 30, 2020 (11:59 p.m. ET).
Submissions may be modified until the January 30 deadline.
