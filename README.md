This repository provides basic templates for the 2-page SDSS 2023 contributed paper submission
with some submission guidelines. 

The templates were created for the 2020 conference. The only change is that authors and affiliations should **NOT** be included on the extended abstract. The review process will be anonymous. 

The templates are available in LaTeX and Microsoft word.

An Overleaf template is available at -https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sdss2023-latex/kwvxycfjytws

The Word template was created using the sample pdf and the Adobe export feature. Using this template will likely require Word formatting skills.

The online submission system will require a short abstract which will be used for the online program. You will be able to
attach a 2-page pdf created using one of the templates.

Submissions of contributed papers will be accepted for consideration from **September 30, 2022 to December 15, 2022 (11:59 p.m. ET)**.
Submissions may be modified until the December 15 deadline.

Submit at https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2023/submitanabstract.cfm

If you have questions or comments about the template contact Donna LaLonde (donnal@amstat.org)
