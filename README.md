 This repository provides basic templates for the 2-page SDSS 2020 contributed paper submission
with some submission guidelines.
The templates are available in LaTex and Microsoft word.
The Word template was created using the sample pdf and the Adobe export feature. Using this template will likely require Word formatting skills.
The online submission system will require a short abstract which will be used for the online program. You will be able to
attach a 2-page pdf created using one of the templates.
Submissions of contributed papers will be accepted for consideration from December 4, 2019, to January 30, 2020 (11:59 p.m. ET).
Submissions may be modified until the January 30 deadline.
Submit at https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2020/submitanabstract.cfm
If you have questions about the template contact Dave Hunter (dhunter@stat.psu.edu) or Donna LaLonde (donnal@amstat.org)
